First i present some code, that has no syntax highlighting:

    ALPHA    GAMMA
         BETA
    ZETAH    CHAIE

Here is an exaple of javascript code:

    function helloWorld()
    {
        // this is great!
        for(var i = 0; i <= 1; i++)
            alert("yay");
    }


Here is the same code with line numbers:

    function helloWorld()
    {
        // this is great!
        for(var i = 0; i <= 1; i++)
            alert("yay");
    }
